	systems is described.
	
	This approach exploits special properties of the highly structured
	ti-diagnosable systems to produce a faulty unit identification algorithm
	which is shown to be of time complexity O(|E|) where |E| corresponds
	to the number of tests in the system.
	
	The diagnosis quality of the algorithm is as follows:
	
	1) if the algorithm identifies a unit as faulty, it is always correct;
	
	
	2) if the collection of test outcomes takes on a form that is compatible
	with a permanent fault situation, the algorithm identifies all of
	the corresponding faulty units; and
	
	3) the algorithm identifies at least one faulty unit over collections
	of test outcomes significantly larger than those that are compatible
	with permanent fault situations.},

	(nodes) in a multiprocessor system to within a set of nodes in which
	at most k nodes are correct, provided the number of faulty nodes
	does not exceed t.
	
	As compared to the classical precise diagnosis strategy, the t/k-diagnosis
	strategy can significantly improve the self-diagnosing capability
	of multiprocessor system.
	
	The generalised cube network (GCN), or equivalently the BC graphs,
	is a regular topology, which provides a unified view of the hypercube
	and some of its variants.
	
	This paper addressed the t/k-diagnosis of GCNs.
	
	By exploring the relationship between the size of a largest connected
	component of the 0-test subgraph of a faulty GCN and the distribution
	of the faulty nodes over the network, an time (4n - 9)/3 diagnosis
	algorithm on an n-dimensional GCN is presented, where N = 2n is the
	total number of the nodes of the network being diagnosed. To our

  Abstract                 = {Data centers have a crucial role in current Internet architecture supporting content-centric networking. State-of-the-art data centers have different architectures like fat-tree, {DCell}, or {BCube.} However, their architectures share a common property: symmetry. Due to their symmetric nature, a tricky point with these architectures is that they are hard to be extended in small quantities. Contrary to state-of-the-art data center architectures, we propose an asymmetric data center topology generation method called Scafida inspired by scale-free networks; these data centers have not only small diameters and high fault tolerance, inherited by scale-free networks, but can also be scaled in smaller and less homogenous increments. We extend the original scale-free network generation algorithm of Barabasi and Albert to meet the physical constraints of switches and routers. Despite the fact that our method artificially limits the node degrees in the network, our data center architectures keep the preferable properties of scale-free networks. Based on extensive simulations we present preliminary results that are promising regarding the error tolerance, scalability, and flexibility of the architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {As critical infrastructures in the Internet, data centers play an important role in supporting large-scale distributed applications as well as data-intensive computing. This chapter presents {CoCell}, a server-centric architecture, which uses servers to relay packets. {CoCell} has several nice properties for desired data center networking. The average node degree in {CoCell} network is close to 3, and the longest routing path length is no larger than 7. Besides, {CoCell} network is able to provide high network capacity to support bandwidth-intensive applications. Leveraging the multi-paths between any pairs of servers in {CoCell} network, we propose relative routing schemes and make a comparison among these paths. The evaluation indicates that {CoCell} performs well in all-to-all traffic pattern.},
